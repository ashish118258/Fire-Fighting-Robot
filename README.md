## Fire Fighting Robot Vehicle

This project is an "autonomous fire-fighting robot vehicle" that detects fire using three flame sensors mounted at the front and automatically moves toward the fire to extinguish it using a water pump.

# Features :
- Detects fire using 3 flame sensors.
- Automatically moves toward the fire source.
- Activates a water pump to extinguish fire.
- Fully autonomous and battery-powered.

# Working Principle :
1. The robot continuously scans the environment with three flame sensors (left, center, right).
2. Depending on which sensor detects fire, the robot turns toward that direction.
3. Once near the fire source, the water pump is activated to extinguish the flame.
